scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments   the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds arise from differences between the conditions under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate  and in how they behave after separation    for turbulent boundary layers  these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly as the reynolds number is changed and in many examples  it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed artificially    the scale effects arising in wind tunnel tests made at low reynolds number may  therefore  often be minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by excrescences attached to the surface    the fact that the effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered at full scale  makes it all the more important to do this whenever possible   several methods which can be used to fix transition are described  and the results obtained by using them are compared   in general  in experiments in two dimensional flow  good agreement is found  and explanations can be advanced for cases in which discrepancies occur    several uncertainties and difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed and illustrated by examples    in particular  special care is needed in interpreting the results obtained with transition fixed at very low reynolds numbers  say  less than about r = 1 x 10 based on local chord for wings of about 0 1 thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner wings    the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased for three dimensional wings  particularly if they are swept back or highly tapered  i e   small chord and reynolds number near the tip  and if the tests cover a large range of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may separate from very close to the leading edge    under these circumstances  it is frequently necessary to place the excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and high angles of incidence  and this is inconvenient in practice   more research is needed before sound recommendations can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed on such models  particularly since in routine testing  it is often not possible to check the effects of transition fixing fully   in the sections dealing with three dimensional tests  examples are given of the spurious results that have been avoided successfully by fixing transition  of the conditions where even at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead of the shock  and of the conditions under which there are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition have been satisfactory

interaction between shock waves and boundary layers  with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes   the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important effects in many problems of high speed flow   this paper has been written as a guide to the literature on the subject  and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications   it will be clear to the reader that  although substantial progress has been made  our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes   part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the development of the theory   these experiments show that the interaction depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave   in particular  the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent   for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface  and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient   the details of the interaction downstream of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer  and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface   many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper   although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds  the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly   the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full scale conditions   for small scale models it is  therefore  frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means   some of the difficulties involved in doing this  and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed   it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight  and connected with the occurrence of shock induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers   for both two dimensional aerofoils and straight and sweptback wings  turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full scale conditions full scale conditions   differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number  but little information is at present available on this point   most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface   this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter relation between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/  and in particular the relative movements of the shock waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow   certain unsteady flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation   some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the occurrence and effects of separation  but in this  as in many other respects  information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce   some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of the paper

heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upper atmosphere   a general method has been developed  using the methods of kinetic theory  whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for steady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas    the particular solution was made for a flat plate   however  the calculations can be easily extended to bodies of arbitrary shape   it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of solar radiation  that is  for the case of nocturnal flight  becomes of negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to steady flight speeds of 36 000 feet per second    the effect of solar radiation  for the case of daytime flight  becomes increasingly important as the flight altitude is increased    at an altitude of 150 miles and higher  solar radiation is the predominating factor that determines skin temperature    owing to the strong effect of solar radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes  the desirability of nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures   in order to maintain low skin temperatures  it was found that the angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should be kept as small as possible    this may be accomplished in practice by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at small angles of attack   it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive and negative angles with respect to the flight path    as much surface as possible should be inclined at negative angles    practically  this may be accomplished by boattailing the body   in the event that an internal skin cooling system is employed  it is shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally by emitted radiation    if the cooling rate is below the natural radiation rate  cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures   it is shown that  in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide range of altitudes and speeds  it is desirable to make the emissivity of the skin as high as possible    this conclusion  however  is based upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy   a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by the decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in thermal accommodation coefficient    this phenomenon may be used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin

on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel   the performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected shock technique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and high temperature real gas effects   particular attention is given to disturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for that the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak enough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary shock mach number  m /e g   5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to remain constant to 10 per cent/   within this range  running times much longer than those obtained in  straight through  shock tunnels are predicted  the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the expansion wave originating at the diaphragm   outside this range of mach number  the uniform flow duration between the arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the contact surface in a  straight through  shock tunnel   at first sight it appears  therefore  that the advantages of reflected shock operation are confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number  unless a heated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for further analysis suggests  however  that subsequent disturbances in the multiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach number   thus  if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected disturbances is used for test purposes  long running times seem possible in theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number   experiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to provide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory   if allowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact surface  fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and transmitted by the contact surface  and for the arrival of the expansion wave reflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised substantially above the  tailored  value  and a limit to the usable flow duration may result   a striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of the tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock   this is attributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its interaction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube   further research is required to check this explanation  and to investigate the effects of reynolds number and of the cross sectional shape and size of the tube   the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion wave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed   it is shown that the arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a severe limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock mach number  and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow duration at high shock mach number   unless means can be devised to suppress the expansion wave  it is demonstrated that it is desirable to have alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over a range of shock mach number   it is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock mach number of 4  falling to  perhaps  1 millisecond at a shock mach number of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using reflected shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air   because of the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations  and the deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments  the present investigation must  however  be regarded as preliminary in character   further research is required to check and extend the findings  and topics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper
